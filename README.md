Snap to surface tool allows the user to select objects and align them to the center of a selected plane in either the X, Y, or Z direction. Optionally, the user can rotate the objects in the direction of the plane.


## Questions for user testers:
- should you be able to align along multiple axes at once?
- is the UI intuitive?
- is there a feature missing?
- would allowing to snap to the center of a 3D object be better or worse?
